# jsmith79-dotfiles
My dotfiles repo. Has files for neovim, tmux, etc. Run the `install.sh` script from inside the directory to install (may need to add the +x flag).

* Once the script runs open tmux and hit Ctrl b I to install tmux plugins
* Open neovim and type :PlugInstall to install the vim plugins
* RTFO ðŸ¤˜
